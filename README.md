Hello there,

This is a game engine I am working on based on python

This game engine is inspired by Unity

This will have an object based scene system with everything written on files

The main objective of this game engine is to reduce the time coding and help the developer concentrate more on
other stuff like artworks and all.

I am making this because most of us waste a lot of time doing the same thing every project when working with pygame

Anyone can contribute to this project

If This Project gets big enough, I will publish this as a python module
